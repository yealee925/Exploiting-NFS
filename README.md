# Exploiting NFS Port

The Exploiting NFS Port Lab's primary focus was to investigate vulnerabilities and gain root access. The lab demonstrates through an open NFS port and poor configuration, a hacker could gain access to a low-privilege shell and escalate privilege up to the root access. The lab provided an example of cybersecurity concepts including privilege escalation and exploitation.

### Skills Learned
- Enhanced knowledge of security vulnerabilities and privilege escalation
- Advanced understanding of hacking techniques
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity

Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.

### Tools Used
- Bash script for

### NFS
Network File System (NFS) allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network by mounting a chosen portion of the file system on a server. The mounted portion of the file system is assigned specific privileges giving clients certain permissions to access the files.
  
## Steps
1. Open the terminal and conduct a thorough Nmap scan of the target system (10.10.129.184), inputting **nmap -A -p- 10.10.129.184**

   - The results show that 7 ports are open and the NFS service is open on port 2049
2. Insert **/usr/sbin/showmount -e 10.10.129.184** to list out the NFS shares

   - The name of a NFS share is *home*
3. Create a directory tying **mkdir /tmp/mount** which will be used to mount the share to our system (this a temporary directory due to the **tmp** command, removing it on restart). Then mount the share using the command: **sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.129.184:home /tmp/mount -nolock. After, change the directory using the **cd** command and input the **ls** command to view inside the share.

   - The share contains the folder *cappucino*
4. Enter the *cappucino* folder using the **cd** command and type the **ls -a** command to view the contents of the file. Note the .ssh folder

5. The .ssh folder may contain keys that would give us remote access to the server, so open the folder using the **cd** command

   - The *id_rsa* key would allow us remote access to the server
6. Copy the *id_rsa* key into our system (in this case the root) by typing **mv id_rsa /root**. Then move back to the /root directory using the **cd** command and check if the file is in the directory with the **ls** command. Now change the permission of the key by inserting **chmod 600 id_rsa**
