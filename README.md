# Exploiting NFS Port

The Exploiting NFS Port Lab's primary focus was to investigate vulnerabilities and gain root access. The lab demonstrates through an open NFS port and poor configuration, a hacker could gain access to a low-privilege shell and escalate privilege up to the root access. The lab provided an example of cybersecurity concepts including privilege escalation and exploitation.

###Skills Learned
- Enhanced knowledge of security vulnerabilities and privilege escalation
- Advanced understanding of hacking techniques
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity

Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.

###Tools Used
- Bash script for

###NFS
Network File System (NFS) allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network by mounting a chosen portion of the file system on a server. The mounted portion of the file system is assigned specific privileges giving clients certain permissions to access the files.
  
##Steps
1. Open the terminal and conduct a thorough Nmap scan of the target system (10.10.129.184), inputting **nmap -A -p- 10.10.129.184**

  - The results show that 7 ports are open and the NFS service is open on port 2049
2. Insert **/usr/sbin/showmount -e 10.10.129.184
